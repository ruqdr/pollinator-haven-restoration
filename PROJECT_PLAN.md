# The Pollinator Haven Restoration Project

## Overview
The Pollinator Haven is a community-led initiative to restore a small plot of land into a thriving native plant garden. Our goal is to support local pollinators, particularly the Monarch butterfly, and serve as an educational resource for the community. By cultivating native species such as Showy Milkweed (*Asclepias speciosa*), we aim to create a sustainable habitat that promotes biodiversity and ecological resilience.

## Challenges
We have discovered a significant infestation of aphids on the Showy Milkweed plants. Aphids are sap‑sucking insects that can weaken the milkweed, reducing its vigor and ability to support Monarch caterpillars. Left unchecked, the aphid population could compromise the health of this crucial host plant and undermine the garden's pollinator‑support objectives.

### Proposed Solution
To manage the aphid outbreak in an ecologically sound manner, we propose releasing native ladybugs (*Hippodamia convergens*) as a biological control agent. Ladybug larvae and adults are voracious predators of aphids and do not harm pollinators or other beneficial insects. The release will be timed to coincide with warm, calm weather, and we will monitor the results closely. Detailed research and a step‑by‑step implementation plan are available in [LADYBUG_RESEARCH.md](./LADYBUG_RESEARCH.md).
